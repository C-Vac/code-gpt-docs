# Auto Changelog

Automated Changelog is a project that aims to add a feature to the [code-gpt-docs](https://github.com/davila7/code-gpt-docs) project. It will automatically generate a changelog based on the commits made to the repository. This will save time for the maintainers and make it easier for users to keep track of the changes made to the project.

## Getting started

To get started with Auto Changelog, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Python and Git on your system.
2. Clone the code-gpt-docs repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `auto_changelog` directory in the cloned repository.
4. Open the `doc_git_changes.py` file in a text editor and replace `YOUR_REPO_PATH` with the path to your local copy of the code-gpt-docs repository.
5. Open the `comb_files_v2.py` file in a text editor and replace `YOUR_REPO_PATH` with the path to your local copy of the code-gpt-docs repository.
6. Open the `comb_files.py` file in a text editor and replace `YOUR_REPO_PATH` with the path to your local copy of the code-gpt-docs repository.
7. Save the changes made to the files.
8. Run the `comb_files_v2.py` script to combine the source code from the code-gpt-docs repository into a single file.
9. Run the `comb_files.py` script to generate a summary of the classes and methods in the source code.
10. Open the `changelog_template.html` file in a text editor and replace `YOUR_REPO_PATH` with the path to your local copy of the code-gpt-docs repository.
11. Save the changes made to the file.
12. Run the `doc_git_changes.py` script to generate a changelog based on the commits made to the repository.

That's it! You have successfully set up Auto Changelog. The generated changelog will be saved to a file called `changelog.html` in the `auto_changelog` directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the changelog.
