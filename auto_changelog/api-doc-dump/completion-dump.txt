Description
The /completion endpoint in the CodeGPT API is designed for user interaction with an AI Agent. To use this endpoint, you send a POST request with a structured JSON object in the body and your API Key in the header.

The API Key should be included in the header as follows: Authorization: Bearer CODEGPT_API_KEY

The JSON object should include the following fields:

agent: This is the unique ID of the AI Agent you want to interact with.
messages: This is an array of message objects. Each object should include a role (either 'user' or 'assistant') and content (the actual text of the message).
When you send this request, the AI Agent processes the 'messages', performs a semantic search on its knowledge base, and generates a response. This response, returned by the API, is the "completion".

Example

  "agentId": "0000-0000-0000-0000",
  "stream":true,
  "format":"json"
  "messages":
  [{
    "content": "What is the meaning of life?",
    "role": "user"
  }]
}
